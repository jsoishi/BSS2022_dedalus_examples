    "In one sense, this is a very pointless equation to solve numerically, since it is a linear, constant coefficient PDE that can be solved exactly. However, we begin with it for two reasons: we have a good *physical* intuition of what the solution will do, and we can make a *quantitative* comparison between our numerical method and the exact solution. I assure you that this is not just a pedegogical exercise that you won't do later in your career. Testing against (and constructing) known analytic solutions (for the mathematically minded student: this is just physics-speak for an exact solution, usually in closed form.) is an **essential part of numerical work**. It is akin to calibrating laboratory instruments. \n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, any PDE requires both initial and boundary conditions. To understand the number of boundary conditions is somewhat complicated, but for the kind of approximations that we are making to solve them, there needs to be **one per spatial derivative**, so in this case, we need two. \n",

    "`d3` can solve differential equations of arbitrary spatial order without performance loss, but for all of the examples we will consider, we will reduce all of the equations to an equivalent first order form. This should be familiar to you from Newton's second law, which we can write as a system of first order equations for $x$ and $v$:\n",
